# Introduction

I'm currently a teacher at KIPP Navigate College Prep in East San Jose. I'm teaching AP Computer Science Principles using the curriculum made available by code.org at https://studio.code.org/courses/csp-2024. For the programming portion of the course we use CMU Academy (https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/course) which uses Python for coding.

This repository contains codes that I write to share with my students.
